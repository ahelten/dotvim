These are my VIM settings, mostly targeting development with C, C++ and Python.
I wrote a blog post about them [here](http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/vim.html).

Here is a [Vimeo-hosted video](http://vimeo.com/37875339) showing some of
the things I can do when I work in C or C++. You can also
[download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ge1imhbivswsixr/Vim.C.and.C++.flv)
a high resolution version of the video for offline playback, using
[MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu) or [VideoLAN](http://www.videolan.org/).

I use a small number of plugins, and did some minor customization for
keyboard shortcuts. The plugins are maintained with pathogen, and
are placed under bundle/ via Git submodules (so I always have the latest
plugin versions).

Installation
-------------

In any new machine/account I need to work on, I clone from the repository:

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/ttsiodras/dotvim .vim
    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cd ..
    ln -s .vim/.vimrc

I therefore use the same VIM environment in all my machines.

For C/C++ development
---------------------

I create /usr/include/tags:

    (become root via su/sudo)
    cd /usr/include
    ctags -R --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q .

My .vimrc is set to use these, as well as any local "tags" I build
in my project-specific Makefiles:

    set tags+=/usr/include/tags

I use [clang complete](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302)
  to get Intellisense-like autocompletion (see the video above).

The 'A' plugin allows me to quickly switch between .h/c{c,pp} with ':A'

Pressing 'K' shows manpages on the symbol under the cursor in an "inner window"
(which allows me to copy/paste). I quickly close the manpage "window" with Ctrl-F12.

F8 shows taglists (macros/types/variables/functions/classes).

For Python development
----------------------

I've mapped F7 to invoke flake8 (install it with: "easy\_install flake8") to get
static analysis error reports from "pyflakes" and style issues from "pep8", navigating
from error to error in the usual way (":cn", ":cp")

I've also added a "screen" based SLIME-like environment. Here's a
[demonstration of the process on Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/37894593)
and an [HD version](http://www.mediafire.com/file/zz9gpv3095fkizl/Vim.SLIME.flv)
that you can download for offline playback, using [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu)
or [VideoLAN](http://www.videolan.org/).


Basically, spawn a screen session via...

    screen -c python.screenrc

(or "python.screenrc.for.ArchLinux" if your screen doesn't support the "split -v"
command) and you will get two screen windows: one with a VIM, one with a python
instance. Navigate to whatever function/class you want in VIM, and hit Ctrl-c Ctrl-c
(i.e. Ctrl-c twice). This will send the function/class to the running python instance.
You can switch between VIM and python via Alt-[ and Alt-]

Generic stuff
-------------

I've mapped:

- NERDTreeToggle to F10, for direct access to "file manager" interface
- TAB and Shift-TAB (in normal mode) cycle buffers
- Ctrl-cursors to navigate windows (or create them, if missing)
- Ctrl-L to clear search results (hate seeing yellow stuff after search)
- Ctrl-F12 to quickly close "window" (buffer)
- I also have easy motion in, so I can navigate to any place in the screen
  with a simple \\\\w followed by a character. Amazing plugin.

Am I insane to use VIM?
-----------------------
[No,](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html) I am [not](http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/vim.html).


Handling ANSI Color Escape Codes
--------------------------------

Use the AnsiEsc plugin to colorize (and hide) text that includes ANSI color escape codes. The plugin
was last updated in 2010 but still works with Vim 8.1.

1. Download the plugin:  https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=302
2. Install per instructions on vim.org:

      vim AnsiEsc.vba.gz
      :so %
      :q 

3. The above installs the files into your `~/.vim/plugin` directory
4. To use the plugin:
   a. Load a file with ANSI color escape codes (e.g. "\x1b[1;31m" in code that becomes something
      like "^[[1;31m" in the log file).
   b. Start the plugin (in vim) using:  `:AnsiEsc`
   c. Text should now be colorized and escape codes hidden.
